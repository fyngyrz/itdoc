This repo contains the documentation for
[iToolBox](http://ourtimelines.com/itdoc/intro.html).

If you'd like, you an download the repo, install it on your own computer
or web server, and then tell `iToolBox` where that root URL is and then
you'll have local documentation.

Keep in mind that the
[online documentation](http://ourtimelines.com/itdoc/intro.html)
is _very_ likely to be at
least a little more up-to-date. However, the convenience of local access
is undeniable, particularly so if you don't actually have a network
connection.
