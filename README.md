# Overview

This repo contains the documentation for
[iToolBox](http://ourtimelines.com/itdoc/intro.html).

If you'd like, you an download the repo, install it on your own computer
or web server, and then tell `iToolBox` where that root URL is and then
you'll have local documentation.

Keep in mind that the
[online documentation](http://ourtimelines.com/itdoc/intro.html)
is _very_ likely to be at
least a little more up-to-date. However, the convenience of local access
is undeniable, particularly so if you don't actually have a network
connection.

# Suggestions

If you have suggestions, please don't go to the trouble of generating
a pull request; these files are generated by my documentation system,
not directly edited so changes to them here will not be reflected in
the actual documentation.

Instead, just open an issue, explain what it is you have found or would
like to see, and I will deal with it from there.

# Unlicense

Both the software executable described by this documentation, and the
documentation itself, are intentionally released into the public domain.


For the software, refer to the [UNLICENSE](UNLICENSE).

For the documentation, to the best of my knowledge, the abandoning
of copyright is effective due to the clear notice on the bottom
of every page of the documentation, to wit:
